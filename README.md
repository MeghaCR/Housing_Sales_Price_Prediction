# Housing_Sales_Price_Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for Ridge and Lasso Regression model, built to predict the housing sales price.

## Problem Statement

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy and to enter the market.

## Objective
Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Determine which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

4: Model Building and Evaluation

## Conclusions

Factors like Living Area, Garage Car capacity, Neighborhood, Number of Bathrooms, Roofing type and overall Quality of the house affects on predicted a house that is undervalued for Sale. 

A prediction model as such can be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
